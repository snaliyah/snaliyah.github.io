                <p>The Sirah (biography) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encompasses numerous significant events, starting with the divine revelation he received from Allah through the Angel Gabriel.
                     The revelation marked the beginning of his prophethood and served as a transformative moment for all of creation.
                      Prophet Muhammad's role as the final messenger of Allah brought forth a new message, the Quran, which contained guidance for humanity in all aspects of life.
                       The revelation was not limited to the Arabian Peninsula but extended to all of mankind, inviting people to embrace monotheism, righteousness, and justice.

                <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
                <p>The year of sorrow refers to a difficult period in the life of Prophet Muhammad that occurred around the tenth year of his prophethood. 
                    During this time, both his beloved wife, Khadijah, and his uncle and protector, Abu Talib, passed away. Their deaths were profound losses for the Prophet,
                     as they provided him with immense support and protection during his early years of spreading Islam. The year of sorrow tested the Prophet's patience and resolve,
                      further emphasizing the challenges he faced in his mission. However, it also strengthened his determination and reliance on Allah, as he continued to preach and spread 
                      the message of Islam despite the personal hardships he endured.

                <p>The Battle of Badr is a crucial event in Islamic history and a significant turning point in the early stages of Islam.
                     It took place in the second year after the migration of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Makkah to Madinah.
                      The Muslims, who were outnumbered and ill-equipped, achieved a remarkable victory against the powerful Quraysh army. 
                      The other side of Badr refers to the aftermath of the battle, where the Muslims faced the challenges of managing the prisoners of war,
                       dealing with the aftermath, and solidifying their position as a new community. It was a time of establishing the principles of mercy, justice, and forgiveness,
                        as the Prophet displayed kindness and compassion towards the defeated enemies, offering them the opportunity to embrace Islam or gain their freedom through various means.

                    <p>The conquest of Makkah marks a pivotal moment in the life of Prophet Muhammad and the history of Islam.
                         After years of persecution and exile from his birthplace, the Prophet returned to Makkah with a large Muslim army in the 8th year of the Islamic calendar.
                          Rather than seeking revenge, the Prophet forgave the people of Makkah for their past hostilities and offered them protection and freedom to embrace Islam. 
                          The conquest of Makkah marked the triumph of Islam over idolatry, and the Kaaba, the sacred house of worship, was cleansed of its idols. It also symbolized
                           the ultimate victory of justice, compassion, and the establishment of the principles of monotheism and righteousness in the Arabian Peninsula. 
                           The conquest of Makkah served as a turning point in the acceptance of Islam by the Arabian tribes and further solidified the authority of Prophet Muhammad as the leader of the growing Muslim community.
